    // First we make object using XMLHttpRequest - Its a method in itself which has readySate and all and through this, we can send or receive data request. We can say, XMLHttpRequest is almost a class. So, in order to make its object, we use new keyword.
    // Opened send the request and it will become available after we have XMLHttpRequest type.

    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    const requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/hiteshchoudhary';
    xhr.open('GET', requestUrl);
    console.log(xhr.readyState);
    // open() takes two parameters. 1st is method which means we want to send which type of request like get, post, put etc. and 2nd parameter is string.
    // open() doesn't get called by itself. We have to execute send().
    // to track continously, we need to change the state, using onreadystatechange. onreadystatechange takes a function to know what needs to be done on state change.
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
      console.log(xhr.readyState);
      if(xhr.readyState === 4){
        let data = this.responseText; // this is used to refer current context.
        console.log(typeof data); // string
        // Most of the time we get response from url in string format. JSON.parse() converts data in JSON.
        data = JSON.parse(data);
        console.log(typeof data); // object
        console.log(data.followers);

    // console and many other API's like document is not part of core JS. console.log() is actually developer's tool. Its injected by JS run-time. Various engines run JS. One of them is V8. Whole V8 engine is written in C++. JS is actually a wrapper over C++.
